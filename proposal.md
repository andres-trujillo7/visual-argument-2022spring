For my visual argument, I want to make something that holds a lot of meaning to me. I want my argument to portray my optimism and how likely I think it is for El Salvador's national soccer team to qualify to the 2026 World Cup. They haven't done it since 1982, and have been struggling to do it since due to certain scandals, poor infrastructure etc. Nevertheless, fortunately, lately, things have been looking up. Just last year, they had a horrible coach who often made questionable decisions, and the players weren't performing, so all hope had seem lost and it seemed like I would never be able to see El Salvador play in the World Cup.

Luckily, that coach left, and a new coach, Hugo Perez, came in and started a process. A process that involves developing players while they're young, calling up new players, and making the players work harder. This process has been paying off so far as seen with our team's recent performances. However, while we have gotten better, the end goal is still qualifying to the World cup, and the process, while going well, is still a process, and that goal is still being worked towards. My stance on this is that I am a big fan of the process and trust in it.

With that being said, what I plan on doing is a picture with El Salvador's stadium in the background with a faint blue or black/white color with the golden World Cup trophy in the middle (in color). To make my argument clear, I want to write either "PROCESS" or "TRUST THE PROCESS" with the Salvadoran players inside of the letters, above the trophy. I'm still deciding on if I want to write those words on English or in Spanish, but know for a fact that this is what my visual argument to represent.
